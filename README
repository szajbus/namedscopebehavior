=NamedScopeBehavior

This is a behavior for CakePHP that allows use of named scopes with model's find() method. What it does it translating defined scopes to conditions before extecuting find query.

==Installation

Download and place named_scope.php file in app/models/behaviors folder of your CakePHP application.

==Usage

Example of User model:

$actsAs = array(
  'NamedScope' => array(
    'activated' => array('User.activated' => 1),
    'online' => array('date_add(User.last_activity, interval 5 minute) > now()')
  )
);

Then in your controller (or anywhere else) you can do:

$this->User->find('all', array('scope' => array('activated')));

which is an equivalent to:

$this->User->find('all', array('conditions' => array('User.activated' => 1)));

You can use many scopes at once and mix them with usually defined conditions:

$this->User->find('all', array('condtions' => array('User.admin' => 1), 'scope' => array('activated', 'online')))

Scope works also with pagination (in your controller):

$paginate = array(
  'User' => array(
    'order' => 'created ASC',
    'limit' => 20,
    'scope' => array('online', 'activated')
  )
)
